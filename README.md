Utilities for building source maps (v3), handling source location representations and source files

## Includes

- `Span`, a structure which represents a section of a specific source
- `SpanWithoutSource`, a structure which represents a general section without a specific source
- `SourceId`, a identifier for a source file
- `StringWithSourceMap`, along with the `ToString` trait makes generating string representations with and adding source markings trivial
- A `lsp-types-morphisms` feature which allows conversion of position type to [lsp-types](https://docs.rs/crate/lsp-types/latest)
- `FileSystem` for storing source files and their information

## Source map example

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kaleidawave/source-map
cd source-map
cargo run -F inline-source-map --example source_map_creation -- LICENSE LICENSE.map
```
