Utilities for building source maps (v3) for a compiler and handling source location representations

## Includes
- `Span`, a structure which represents a section of a specific source
- `SourceId`, a identifier for a source file
- `StringWithSourceMap`, along with the `ToString` trait makes generating string representations with and adding source markings trivial
- With the `lsp-types-morphisms` features makes converting between the position information in [lsp-types](https://docs.rs/crate/lsp-types/latest) easy

## Example

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kaleidawave/source-map
cd source-map
cargo run -F inline-source-map --example source_map_creation -- LICENSE LICENSE.map
```
